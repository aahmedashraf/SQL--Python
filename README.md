End-to-end data analytics workflow using Python and SQL. Kaggle API is used to download the dataset, Pandas for processing and cleaning the data, which is then loaded into a SQL Server database. Finally, I answer the following questions using SQL queries to extract meaningful insights from the data:
 -- TOP 10 HIGHEST REVENUE GENERATING PRODUCT -- 
 -- TOP 5 highest selling products in each region --
 -- Monthly comparison for 2022 vs 2023 sales -- 
 -- For each category, which month had the highest sales --
 -- Which sub category had the highest growth in profit in 2023 compared to 2022 --
